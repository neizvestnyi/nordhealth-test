Task 4: Bug Fixes, Code Refactoring, and Test Implementation

Fixed bugs found in the initial commit, refactored controllers to follow clean architecture, added logging, and implemented comprehensive unit tests.

Bugs Fixed

**Bug 1: Wrong return type in AppointmentController.CreateAppointment**
- Method signature had `ActionResult<Animal>` instead of `ActionResult<Appointment>`
- Fixed during Task 1 implementation

**Bug 2: Missing StartTime/EndTime in AppointmentData**
- Second appointment in AppointmentData.cs was missing required StartTime and EndTime properties
- Fixed during Task 1 implementation when data was updated

**Bug 3: Solution file typo**
- File was named "Calender.sln" instead of "Calendar.sln"
- Fixed: Renamed file to correct spelling

**Bug 4: Obsolete weatherforecast endpoint in Api.http**
- Api.http referenced non-existent /weatherforecast endpoint
- Fixed: Replaced with actual API endpoints (animal and appointment operations)

Additional Issues Found

**Bug 5: CustomerId property**
- Original Appointment model referenced CustomerId which didn't exist in Animal model
- Fixed during Task 3 when implementing proper relationships with EF Core

**Bug 6: Grammar issue in README.md**
- Line 42: "if exits" should be "if exists"
- Not fixed as per instruction

Code Refactoring

**Controller Cleanup**
- Moved all business logic from controllers to service layer
- Controllers now only handle HTTP concerns and delegate to services
- Consistent pattern across all controllers using Result<T> pattern

**Services Created**
- `IAnimalService` and `AnimalService` for animal operations
- Extended `IAppointmentService` and `AppointmentService` with Create and GetById methods
- All services follow the same pattern established in Tasks 1 and 2

**Logging Implementation**
- Added Serilog for structured logging throughout the application
- Configured log levels: Warning for general, Error for Microsoft and EF Core
- Added request logging middleware with performance metrics
- Service layer logs errors with contextual information (e.g., AnimalId, AppointmentId)
- Logs output to console and daily rotating file logs

**Benefits**
- Controllers are now thin and focused on HTTP concerns only
- Business logic is testable in isolation
- Consistent error handling using Result pattern
- Better separation of concerns
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

**API Documentation**
- Added XML documentation to all controllers and endpoints
- Added ProducesResponseType attributes for all possible response codes
- Added Produces("application/json") at controller level
- Comprehensive parameter and return value documentation for Swagger/OpenAPI

Unit Testing

**Test Project Setup**
- Created Api.Tests project using xUnit
- Added testing packages: Moq, FluentAssertions, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests for service layer

**Test Coverage**
- AnimalService: 8 tests covering all methods
  - CreateAnimalAsync: validation, success, and error cases
  - GetAnimalByIdAsync: found, not found, and error cases
  - DeleteAnimalAsync: success, not found, and error cases
- AppointmentService: 17 tests covering all methods
  - CreateAppointmentAsync: validation, success, and error cases
  - GetAppointmentByIdAsync: found and not found cases
  - GetAppointmentsByVeterinarianAndDateRangeAsync: success and missing data cases
  - UpdateAppointmentStatusAsync: various status transitions, business rules, and error cases

**Test Characteristics**
- All 25 tests passing
- Uses AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern
- Mocks all external dependencies
- Tests both happy paths and error scenarios
- Validates business rules (e.g., appointment cancellation restrictions)
- Tests status migrations (InProgress → Scheduled, NoShow → Cancelled)

Technical Details

- All controllers now follow the pattern: receive request → call service → return result
- Services handle validation, business logic, and repository operations
- Error handling is consistent using ResultHelper.ToActionResult()
- Logging captures errors with contextual information for easier debugging
- Tests ensure service layer logic works correctly in isolation
- Code compiles without errors (only warnings for obsolete status enums remain)

Assumptions

- Service layer pattern from Tasks 1 and 2 should be applied consistently
- Controllers should not contain business logic or direct repository access
- Result<T> pattern provides better error handling than exceptions in controllers
- Comprehensive logging is essential for production debugging
- Unit tests should focus on service layer logic, not infrastructure
